# Document Classification using Count Vectorizer

This project aims to classify documents using the Count Vectorizer technique, a fundamental method in natural language processing (NLP) for text classification tasks. The Count Vectorizer converts text data into a matrix of word counts, enabling the use of machine learning algorithms to classify documents effectively.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate document classification by utilizing the Count Vectorizer method. It involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis and model training.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using Count Vectorizer to convert text documents into numerical feature vectors.
3. **Model Training**: Employing machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) for document classification based on the extracted features.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the classification models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
